# References {-}

This sections lists the references used in the course - it will be updated as the notes are updated. Some of the more accessible (dare I say 'interesting') resources are linked from the notes. If you want to read any of these articles, the easiest way is to copy the title into [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/).
